CSE 5045 ‚Äì Hackathon Projects
Welcome to the repository for hackathon projects completed as part of the CSE 5045 ‚Äì Topics in Computer Engineering graduate-level course.
Each subdirectory in this repository contains the solution to a specific hackathon challenge focused on real-world machine learning tasks.

üéØ Objective
The aim of these hackathons is to deepen understanding of core machine learning principles by applying them to practical problems. Projects span tasks such as regression, classification, and data preprocessing, with varying constraints on algorithm implementation.

Each hackathon in this repository addresses a real-world machine learning task. Depending on the challenge requirements, some projects include custom implementations of machine learning algorithms, while others leverage high-level libraries and pre-built models to focus on experimentation, feature engineering, and evaluation.

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
Each hackathon explores different aspects of the ML pipeline:

Data Cleaning & Exploration: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature correlation analysis.

Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical variables, scaling, polynomial features, and domain-specific transformations.

Modeling: Ranges from manual implementation of algorithms (e.g., gradient descent) to utilizing models from libraries like scikit-learn or XGBoost.

Evaluation: Using appropriate metrics such as MSE, accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.

üìö Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Custom algorithm implementations where required

High-level libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, xgboost) depending on project rules

üìå Notes
All code and documentation reflect individual contributions under academic integrity rules.

The repository serves as both a learning resource and a portfolio of applied machine learning projects.
